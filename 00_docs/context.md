# Context

Goal: simulate a realistic **brownfield takeover** of an organically grown Azure environment and document how a platform engineer would:
1) assess the existing state
2) identify governance/cost/security hygiene issues,
3) plan a safe, non-destructive covergence to Terraform,
4) verify progress with repeatable exports and reports.
